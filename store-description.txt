Capital Enforcer automatically converts all text inputs to uppercase on Veryon Tracking+ pages.

HOW IT WORKS
Once installed, every text field and textarea on Tracking+ is transformed to uppercase as you type. Pasted text is converted automatically. The extension handles dynamically loaded fields, so it works seamlessly across the entire application.

FEATURES
• Automatic uppercase conversion on all text inputs
• Handles paste events with instant conversion
• Works with dynamically added fields (modals, tabs, etc.)
• Preserves cursor position while typing
• Preserves the German Eszett (ß) character
• Simple on/off toggle via the popup
• Lightweight — no background processes, no network requests

PRIVACY
This extension operates entirely within your browser. It does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data. No analytics, no tracking, no network requests. Your enable/disable preference is stored locally on your device.
