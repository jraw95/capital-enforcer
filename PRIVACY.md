- **No keystroke logging.** Text transformation happens locally in your browser and is never sent anywhere.
- **No network requests.** The extension makes zero outbound connections.
- **No analytics or tracking.** No usage data is collected or shared with any third party.
- **No cookies.** The extension does not read or write cookies.

## Local Storage

The extension uses `chrome.storage.local` solely to persist your enable/disable preference. This data never leaves your device.

## Permissions
